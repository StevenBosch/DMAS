Reinforcement learning system

Expectation of new situation based on previous success and assessment current situation.


Learning function:
Success rate * Temp * assessment current situation


Success rate:
(saves + kills - losses)/(saves + kills + losses)

Assessment current situation:
noise * agents/(agents + hostiles)
noise * hostiles/(agents + hostiles)


Pay off tables:

Agents:	Hostiles: Run Shoot
Save 
Shoot


Decision tables (agents):

	Overtal Ondertal
Save
Shoot

Decision tables (hostiles):
	Overtal Ondertal
