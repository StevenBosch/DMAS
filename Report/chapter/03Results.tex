\section{Results}

The first simulations were run with learning rate values of $0.8$, $0.5$, $0.2$ and $0.0$, corresponding to the inexperienced, mixed-experienced, experienced and non-learning cops. Following, the simulation with a decreasing learning rate, starting at $0.8$ was run. The mean performance and standard deviation (SD) can be found in \autoref{tab:ResultsCur}.

\begin{tabular}{l r  r}
$\lambda$ &  \# epochs (SD) & success (SD)\\

0.0 & 17.79 (1.623) & 0.25 (0.036) \\
0.2 & 17.66 (2.194) & 0.25 (0.036) \\
0.5 & 18.12 (2.502) & 0.25 (0.036) \\
0.8 & 18.45 (2.288) & 0.25 (0.036) \\
<0.8 & 17.53 (1.825) & 0.25 (0.036) \\

A Repeated Measure ANOVA showed that there was no main effect of the different simulation on both the success (F(5,25) = 387; p = 0.853) or the amount of epochs (F(5,24) = 1.396; p = 0.261). Post-hoc pairwise comparison, using Bonferoni Correction, confirmed this, showing only non-significant differences between the different simulations.
