\chapter{Method}

Q-learning implements a decrese in learning rate by adjusting the learning rate variable $\lambda$ over time (REF). In temporal difference learning this is achieved by storing memories (of actions and results) in time (REF). Over time these memories will decay (less often experienced ones quicker than more experienced ones) allowing a flexible learning of the best actions/strategies. For this simulation, the learning rate variable will be implemented.
