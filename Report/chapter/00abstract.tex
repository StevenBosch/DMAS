Much research has been done to how civil violence may emerge, but less focus has been on what factors affect cop performance to control civil violence. In this paper, the effect of experience of cops on overal group performance is investigated using a multi-agent simulation. Cops that have a lot of experience tend to stick to known and successful behavior (low learning rate), whera new cops, having less experiences, are more likely to switch behavior after unexpected unfavourable outcomes (high learning rate), which may affect group dynamics. Some significant differences were found between learning rates; these were marginal though. A large effect was seen between different biases for strategies. An aggressive approach resulted in less casualties at the cost of mitigation speed, whereas a more peaceful approach increased the speed of mitigating civil violence at the cost of many cop and civilian casualties. Though the current simulation was rather simplistic, the results do show that multi-agent modeling is a useful tool for understanding group dynamics, and may provide us with the possibility to test and compare civil violence mitigations strategies.
