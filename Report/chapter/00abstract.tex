Much research has been done to how civil violence may emerge, but less focus has been on what factors affect cop performance to control civil violence. In this paper, the effect of experience of cops, modeled by individual learning rates, on the overal group performance is investigated. No significant results were found for the success, nor for speed of resolving the issue. Because of the lack of results and some shortcomings to the model, no conclusions can be drawn.
