Much research has been done to how civil violence may emerge, but less focus has been on what factors affect cop performance to control civil violence. In this paper, the effect of experience of cops, modeled by individual learning rates, on the overal group performance is investigated. No significant results were found for the success, nor for speed of resolving the issue. Moreover, the overal mean utility of either shooting and saving in all situations did not differ in a large degree, all having a 50\% chance of being selected. These results suggest that both saving and shooting is of equal importance, and that individual learning rates do not have a large impact on the success of the group. Because the simulation was rather simplistic, care should be taken when trying to transfer the implications to real life.
